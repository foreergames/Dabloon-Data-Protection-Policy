Data Protection Policy for the app dabloon

Dabloon Data Protection Policy (Datenschutzerklärung):

Welcome to the dabloon app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Yunus Özkul. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. We only save numbers (for example how many dabloons you have) in your device and they can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, Yunus Özkul Vienna, Austria helpforeergames@gmail.com
